Problem Statement


Objective
The primary objective of this analysis is to develop a machine learning system capable of extracting insights from online patient drug reviews. The system will:

-       Perform sentiment analysis to determine patient satisfaction.

-       Predict drug effectiveness based on textual review content and patient characteristics.

-       Classify the severity of side effects described in patient reviews.

This is to enhance understanding of patient experiences and support evidence-based decision-making in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries.

The Key Variables here are:

Drug Name: Identifier for the medication being reviewed.
Condition: The medical condition for which the drug was taken.
Review Text: Unstructured textual data describing patient experiences.
Rating: Numeric value reflecting the patient’s overall satisfaction (typically 1–10).
Effectiveness: A score or classification of how well the drug worked for the user.
Side Effects: Descriptions and possible severity ratings of adverse reactions.

Expected Relationships
-       Sentiment Score ↔ Rating: A strong positive correlation is expected between the sentiment score derived from review text and the user’s numeric rating.

-       Review Features ↔ Effectiveness: Text features (e.g., keywords, duration of use) and structured inputs (e.g., drug, condition) are expected to significantly influence the predicted effectiveness of a drug.

-        Side Effect Keywords ↔ Severity Clusters: Patterns in word usage within side effect descriptions are expected to naturally group into clusters corresponding to different severity levels using unsupervised learning techniques.
