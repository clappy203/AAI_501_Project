## Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1: Sentiment Analysis
**Expectation**: Online drug reviews contain rich, unstructured textual data that can be used to accurately predict patient sentiment through NLP techniques.

**EDA Test**: 
- Perform sentiment analysis on review texts using NLP models
- Compare sentiment scores with numerical ratings provided in the dataset
- Use statistical tests (e.g., correlation analysis) to validate the relationship between sentiment and ratings
- Success criteria: Strong positive correlation between sentiment scores and numerical ratings

### Hypothesis 2: Drug Effectiveness Prediction
**Expectation**: Machine learning models can accurately predict drug effectiveness based on textual review content and patient characteristics.

**EDA Test**:
- Extract key features from review texts (e.g., symptom descriptions, duration of use)
- Build supervised learning models to predict effectiveness ratings
- Compare model performance against baseline metrics
- Success criteria: Model accuracy significantly higher than random chance

### Hypothesis 3: Side Effect Severity Classification
**Expectation**: Unsupervised learning can identify meaningful patterns in side effect descriptions and classify their severity.

**EDA Test**:
- Apply topic modeling to identify common side effect themes
- Develop clustering algorithms to group similar side effects
- Validate clusters against known medical classifications
- Success criteria: Clear separation of side effects by severity with medical relevance
